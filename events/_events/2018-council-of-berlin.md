---

The Council of Berlin is one of the three tri-annual in-person gatherings of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians; the other two are shoulder events to EthCC in Q1 and Devcon in Q4.

While our in-person meetings facilitate technical discussions, the Magicians intend for decisions to be finalized in the [online forums](https://ethereum-magicians.org) so that the broadest number of people can participate.

### June 30: Where are we now? Where are we going?

James Pitts wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@jpitts/take-a-break-from-buidling-and-ask-where-are-we-now-where-are-we-going-5f89c2463d93) about the state of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, and provided an overview of the upcoming Council of Berlin.

### May 28: Agenda, Call for Lightning EIP Talks & Sponsors

Please check out the [proposed agenda](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15/377) wiki on the EthMagicians forum.

We are making a “Call for Lightning EIP Talks”. We want to provide space where people can live present their EIP, either as needed for discussion by all of the Magicians or by focused Working Groups. The format will be 3 slides and a 5 minute presentation, with a brief 5 minute Q&A session. These presentations will be livestreamed and recorded, and will help determine what gets discussed. Please [add your Lightning EIP Talk to the wiki](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15/377).

Is your project or company interested in sponsoring to cover costs? Check out the [Sponsor Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIErPvt0ElTJFypA5S06eYpAxHaF4Cef7DErWHVOT18/edit?usp=sharing).

### May 15: Magicians Meetings, Confirming July 14 - 15th at c-base

We’ve heard you loud and clear! [The word “council” has been raising some eyebrows](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/the-term-council-may-be-easily-misunderstood-by-ourselves-and-the-community/357) as it sounds exclusive and not welcoming.

We’re evolving everything about this process out in the open, so please do participate and we’ll figure it out together.

For now – other than the repo name! – we think we’re going to consistently call these Magicians Meetings, with this being the Summer Meeting. The Spring Meeting was at EthCC in Paris, and the Fall Meeting will be around Devcon.

We are also confirming that the dates will be July 14th & 15th, and the venue will be [c-base](https://c-base.org/).

Please do let us know if you’ll join us – or any other comments – by filling out the Expression of Interest form.

### May 12: 2018 Expression of Interest

Please fill out the Expression of Interest survey. This helps us plan the sessions in Berlin, most importantly having a venue that is large enough to include all of those that want to attend.

Update: the [sign up](https://ethereum-magicians.github.io/berlin-council/register/) is up now.
